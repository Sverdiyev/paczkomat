# paczkomat task for Envelo

## Highlights

1. app fully written in TypeScript
1. validity takes into account if the inputs were touched or not. Same behaviour is taken into account for button.
1. Used localStorage for reloads - you can refresh the page and the phone number & code will be saved, also your "stage" progress
1. type = 'tel' for inputs - better user design for phone users
1. Did not focus on styling, however implemented minor responsiveness

## Improvement possibilities

1. Styling
1. Responsiveness
1. make updateState function which will perform the update and re-render of the page instead of repeating code
